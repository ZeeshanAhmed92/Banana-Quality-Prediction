# **Banana Quality Prediction** 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the quality of bananas based on their physical
characteristics. The quality of bananas is a crucial factor in the fruit industry, as it directly affects the consumer's satisfaction and the profitability of the business.

# **Description**
In this code we have tried various calssification models to predict the quality of bananas with given set of features.

- We first tuned the models.
- Then perform cross validation on each model.
- Then calculated various scores on all models.
- Then we selected the best perform model and then finally checked the confusion matrix for that model.
